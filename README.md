# 📘 Daily LeetCode Practice — Topic-Oriented Learning Log

This repository documents my **daily LeetCode practice** with a strong focus on **deep understanding**, not just solving problems.

Instead of stopping at one accepted solution, each problem is explored across **all relevant topics and approaches** (for example: Array, Bit Manipulation, Hashing, etc.).  
Each solution is backed by **submission proof screenshots** to ensure authenticity and traceability.

## 🧠 Why this Repository Exists

Most LeetCode practice ends at a green “Accepted” checkmark.  
This repo goes further by answering:

- Why does this solution work?
- What other approaches exist for the same problem?
- What trade-offs are involved (time, space, clarity)?
- Can I explain this to someone else clearly?

This approach helps me:

- Build conceptual depth
- Strengthen interview explanations
- Maintain a public proof-of-work trail

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized **by date**, representing daily practice sessions.

```(yaml)
root/
├── README.md        ← You are here
├── 2026-02-01/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── Arrayapproach.py
│   ├── Bitmanipulation.py
│   ├── image1.png
│   └── image2.png
├── 2026-02-02/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
```

### Inside Each Date Folder

Each date folder contains:

- A problem-specific README.md
- Multiple solution files (one per approach/topic)
- Submission proof screenshots corresponding to each approach

---

## 📝 Per-Problem Documentation Format

Each problem README follows a consistent structure:

1. Problem statement + LeetCode link
2. Approach 1
   - Code
   - Submission proof image
   - Explanation (intuition, complexity, trade-offs)
3. Approach 2
   - Code
   - Submission proof image
   - Explanation
4. Key takeaways

## ✅ What This Repo Is (and Isn’t)

**This repo IS:**

- A learning log
- A structured revision tool
- A portfolio of problem-solving depth

**This repo is NOT:**

- A copy-paste solution dump
- A speedrun leaderboard
- A tutorial site

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Goal

Over time, this repository should:

- Show consistent daily effort
- Demonstrate topic-wise mastery
- Reflect growth in reasoning and explanation
- Act as a personal DSA knowledge base
